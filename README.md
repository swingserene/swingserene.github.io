**Data Analytics | Machine Learning | AI-Assisted Workflows**  
Graduate Student, Data Analytics & Computational Social Science 
University of Massachusetts Amherst

This GitHub site is a draft version of my data and research portfolio. I’m building it as I progress through the program, and I plan to continue adding more projects as my skills develop. My interests include data analytics, practical machine learning, and exploring how AI can support real analytical workflows.


## About Me

I enjoy working on projects that connect data to real-world questions. I’m especially interested in how AI can help automate routine parts of analysis while still requiring thoughtful human interpretation. My goal is to build a solid foundation in analytics and machine learning, and apply it to meaningful problems in organizations.


## Featured Projects  
*(Work in progress — more coming soon)*

### 1. Credit Risk Analysis Using Logistic Regression
A Python classification project exploring how demographic and financial variables relate to credit card default using the UCI dataset.  
**What I learned:**  
- Setting up a basic ML workflow  
- Cleaning and preparing data  
- Evaluating model performance (accuracy/AUC)  
- Understanding the strengths and limits of logistic regression  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
**Repo:** Coming soon

### 2. Social Network Analysis: Harry Potter (Book 3)
A network analysis project examining character relationships and community structure.  
**What I learned:**  
- Applying centrality and reciprocity measures  
- Detecting communities  
- Visualizing and interpreting network patterns  
**Tools:** R, igraph  
**Repo:** Coming soon


## Technical Skills

**Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R (tidyverse, igraph), SQL, Git  
**Analytics & ML:** Logistic Regression, classification workflows, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model evaluation  
**Tools:** GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Qualtrics, Tableau (in progress)


## Current Focus Areas

- AI-assisted analytics  
- Human–AI collaboration in data workflows  
- Model evaluation and interpretation  
- Data storytelling and visualization  


## Work in Progress

This portfolio is still developing. Upcoming improvements include:  
- Additional machine learning projects  
- More polished data visualizations  
- AI-assisted analysis examples  
- Better project organization and documentation
